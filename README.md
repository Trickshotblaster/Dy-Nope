# Dy-Nope
Stops DyKnow from running (posted publicly so that the devs can fix the issue)

# Installation:
Download the code as a zip file and extract its contents, then copy stopper.py and paste it somewhere in the desktop folder so it can be run without opening a file manager. make sure you have python installed from the software center, and then install the necessary modules using command prompt (python -m pip install library_name_here --user). You may also need to upgrade pip. Then, simply double click on the script from the desktop and it will run.

(Installation steps are intentionally difficult to follow without python experience to prevent misuse)
